### Step 2: Preparing for Theme Creation ‚ùó
To create a theme, you‚Äôll need to modify certain Discord interface elements. Here‚Äôs how to access and inspect those elements:

1. **Open the Inspector Panel**  
   - On **Windows**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + I`
   - On **Mac**: Press `‚å• + ‚åò + I`

   The inspector will open, allowing you to view and interact with the HTML structure of Discord.

2. **Select Elements to Style**  
   After the inspector opens:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + C` to select specific elements on the page.

3. **Identifying Classes**  
   As you hover over Discord elements, you‚Äôll see their class names displayed. For example, selecting an icon in the chat box might show `icon-3D60ES`. Note down the classes of the elements you want to style, as you‚Äôll use these in your theme file.

   - Option 2: Open the folder directly by navigating to `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\themes`

2. **Create Your Theme File**  
   - Inside the themes folder, create a new file with the `.theme.css` extension, such as `CustomTheme.theme.css`.

### Step 4: Adding Basic Theme Metadata üìù

To ensure your theme works, begin your file with metadata. Copy the following template and update it with your theme details:

```css
/**
  * @name YourThemeName
  * @author YourName#1234
  * @version 1.0
  * @description A brief description of your theme.
  * @authorId YourDiscordID
  * @authorLink https://yourwebsite.com
  * @source https://github.com/YourGitHubRepo
  * @website https://yourwebsite.com
  * @invite discordInviteCode
*/
```

- **Required Fields**: `@name`, `@version`, and `@description` are necessary for the theme to function properly.

### Step 5: Writing Theme Code üíª
Now, it‚Äôs time to add custom styles to your theme file:

1. **Basic Styling**  
   - Using the class names you collected earlier, write CSS to style Discord elements as you like.  
   - For example, to change the color of an icon class, your code might look like this:

   ```css
   .icon-3D60ES {
       color: #bb86fc;
   }
   ```

2. **Preview and Tweak**  
   Save your changes and load the theme in Discord to see how it looks. Adjust as necessary by adding styles or modifying the existing ones.

3. **Customization Options**  
   Once you‚Äôre comfortable with CSS, experiment with advanced options like:
   - **Changing Icon Styles**: Swap out icons for custom ones or change their colors.
   - **Adding Animations**: Make elements animate on hover or when interacting with them.
   - **Repositioning Elements**: Move components to different parts of the UI.
